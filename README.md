# JavaDocConverterExtension
Visual Studio Extension for Converting JavaDoc to XML Document

This Extension is just for converting JavaDoc into XML Document
Also, it covers most of the case (at least satisfied my project), but not expect PERFECT work.  :)

Simply, download this source code and build it.
And install in your environment.
You may see in the Tools menu, and [Ctrl + 2] would be the keybord short cut.

Don't blame me about the "DIRTY" code.  It is just a day hack code.  (Seriously, I spent only a half day!)
